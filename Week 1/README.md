# Homework # 1: HTML Resume

It's recruiting season which means that you'll need a resume to show the world your skills and experiences. The goal of this homework assignmnet is to familiarize you with HTML, so play around with different tags and formats. Don't worry about making the resume pretty, we'll do that next week when we learn CSS :)

## Instructions

Make sure you have a text editor installed (ie. vscode) on your machine before proceeding. Don't worry if you can't get the styling to look as we're going to build on top of this assignment with CSS next week.

1. Open your text editor of choice inside the `homework` directory.
2. Create a new file called `resume.html`.
3. Your resume should at least have the following properties
   - Name
   - Email
   - Phone Number
   - Education Section
     - School
     - Major
     - Graduation Date
     - Course Work
4. Here are some ideas on optional fields you can include
   - Awards
   - Skills and Tools
   - Org Membership
   - Work Experience
   - Volunteering Experience
     (you may also choose to embedd or include css, styling, and images!)
5. Save your HTML file and reflect on your masterpiece.
